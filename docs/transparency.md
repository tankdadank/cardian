## What Cardian is

Cardian is a Discord card-game bot built around clean UI, button-driven play, and fair competition.

## What Cardian stores

- Discord IDs (user and server)
- Game results and basic stats
- Achievements
- Custom presets you save
- Ranked and SVS match logs (including point or rating changes)
- Flags and moderation actions used for integrity

## What Cardian does not store

- Your message content for normal operation
- Your private conversations
- Any unnecessary personal information

## How Ranked and SVS work

- Only stable, shipped variants are used in Ranked.
- SVS requires eligible servers and includes anti-farming protections.
- If behavior looks abusive, matches can be flagged and points may be withheld until review.

## Source availability and abuse prevention

Some parts of Cardian may be source-available. Certain anti-abuse thresholds and enforcement tuning are kept private to reduce farming and bypass attempts.

## Resets and retention

- Ranked and SVS reset monthly.
- Integrity logs are kept up to 3 months, then removed.

## Support and appeals

Moderation and appeals are handled by humans in the support server.
