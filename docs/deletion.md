# Data Deletion Policy

This explains what gets wiped when you delete your data, and what I might keep for a bit to stop cheating and ban dodging.

## What you can delete

When you delete your data, this gets removed:

- your profile and casual stats
- your achievements
- your saved custom presets
- your custom game history

Deletion is permanent for the stuff listed above.

## What I might keep (for integrity)

Even after you delete, Cardian may keep a small amount of stuff for a limited time to keep ranked fair and prevent ban evasion, like:

- recent Ranked and SVS match logs (only for reviews/investigations)
- enforcement records like warnings and bans (so people can’t dodge bans by wiping)

This isn’t used for public stats and it isn’t shown on profiles.

## How long it’s kept

- integrity logs are purged on a schedule (usually up to 3 months)
- ban records can stick around while a ban is active, and a bit after, to prevent ban dodging

## What happens when you delete

- your visible stats are removed
- your presets are removed
- your achievements are removed
- if you come back later, you’re treated like a new user, except where bans or integrity records still apply

## How to delete

You can delete through:

- the website (recommended)
- the bot interface (also recommended)

If deletion fails because something’s down, open a support ticket and I’ll sort it out.
