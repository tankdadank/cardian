## 1. What Cardian collects

Cardian stores only what’s needed to run the bot and protect competitive integrity.

### Account identifiers
- Discord user ID
- Discord server ID (used for SVS and server-scoped features)

### Gameplay and progression
- Game participation and results
- Achievements
- Custom preset metadata (names, settings, variant choices, modifier selections)

### Ranked and SVS integrity logs
- Match results and rating or point changes
- Opponent identifiers internally (not shown on public profiles)
- Timestamps
- Flags and enforcement actions

### Website-related
- Discord OAuth login identifier
- Session data needed to keep you logged in

Cardian does not store message content as part of normal operation.

## 2. What Cardian does not collect
- No scanning your DMs
- No logging your chat messages for analytics
- No selling data
- No advertising profiles

## 3. Why Cardian collects it
- To run games, profiles, achievements, and custom presets
- To calculate Ranked ratings and SVS points
- To prevent abuse and investigate cheating or farming when needed

## 4. Where data is shown
- Visible to you (and sometimes others, depending on the command): basic stats and achievements
- Not publicly shown: opponent identifiers and integrity logs used for review

## 5. Retention
- Ranked and SVS logs: kept up to 3 months for integrity review, then purged
- General profile and gameplay data: kept until you delete it (or the service is discontinued)
- Website caching: pages may be delayed by up to 60 seconds due to caching

## 6. Your choices
- You can view and delete eligible data through the bot and the website
- Some integrity and moderation records may be kept as needed to enforce bans or handle abuse

## 7. Security
Cardian takes reasonable steps to protect stored data. No system is perfect, but access is limited and secrets stay in environment configuration.

## 8. Contact
Privacy questions are handled through the support server.
