# Terms of Service

## 1. What Cardian is

## 2. Eligibility

- You must follow Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
- Cardian is intended for users who are at least 13 years old (or the minimum age Discord requires in your region).
- If you are banned from Cardian services, you may not use alternate accounts or servers to evade that ban.

## 3. What you can do

- Use Cardian to play in Casual, Ranked, Custom, and SVS (where available).
- Use the website to manage saved custom presets and submit art (if enabled).

## 4. What you cannot do

You agree not to:

- exploit bugs, automation, or coordination to farm rewards, ratings, SVS points, or achievements
- manipulate SVS using servers you own or control to feed wins to another server
- attempt to reverse engineer private anti-abuse thresholds or bypass detection and enforcement
- harass staff, moderators, or other players through Cardian features
- submit NSFW, hateful, or illegal content anywhere Cardian is used
- submit stolen, traced, or unauthorized artwork

## 5. Competitive integrity and enforcement

- Ranked and SVS are reviewed by humans.
- Cardian may flag suspicious behavior and temporarily withhold credit for matches while a review happens.
- If a match is deemed abusive or invalid, results may be removed or ignored for scoring.
- Enforcement can include warnings, temporary bans, permanent bans, or server bans.

## 6. Availability and downtime

- Cardian is provided as-is and may have downtime.
- Maintenance may pause games shortly before it begins.
- Cardian does not guarantee uninterrupted service.

## 7. Payments and donations

- Donations or memberships never grant gameplay advantages in Ranked or SVS.
- Donor perks, if offered, are cosmetic or convenience-only.
