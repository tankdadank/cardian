1. Definitions
------------------------------------------------------------

"Licensor" means tankdadank and any entity the Licensor controls.

"Software" means the source code and build scripts in this repository labeled "Cardian", excluding:
(a) third-party dependencies, and (b) trademarks, logos, artwork, and branding assets unless a file
explicitly says they are included.

"Repository" means the public Git repository where the Licensor publishes the Software.

"Discontinued" means any one of the following happens:
A) The Licensor archives the Repository (GitHub "archived" state or equivalent), OR
B) There is no Maintenance Activity for 12 consecutive months.

"Maintenance Activity" means at least one of:
- a commit to the default branch of the Repository, OR
- a tagged release (or release publication) in the Repository.

"Competing Use" means providing the Software (or a substantially similar derivative) to third parties
as a product or service that competes with Cardian, including:
- hosting Cardian for other people as a paid service,
- selling access to a hosted Cardian instance,
- bundling Cardian into a commercial bot offering,
- operating a public "Cardian-like" bot whose primary purpose is to replace Cardian.

Running Cardian for your own communities/servers, even if you accept donations for your community,
is not Competing Use, as long as you are not selling Cardian itself as a service/product.
