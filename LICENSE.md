"Commercial Use" means any use intended for monetary gain, including but not limited to paid hosting, subscriptions, sponsorship-based access, resale, licensing, or bundled distribution.

## 6. Termination

This license terminates automatically if you violate any restriction.

Upon termination, you must cease use and distribution immediately.

## 7. Discontinuation

If the operator publicly declares Cardian permanently discontinued, the Software will no longer be governed by active development restrictions.

At that time, the Software will be relicensed under the Cardian Community License (CCL), as published by the operator.

Commercial Use remains prohibited unless explicitly authorized in writing.

No automatic relicensing to an open-source license occurs.
