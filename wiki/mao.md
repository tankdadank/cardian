# Mao (Open Rules)

> ⚠️ **Experimental Game** - Requires Patreon role to play

A turn-based card shedding game with explicit, visible rule triggers. Unlike traditional Mao where rules are secret, this variant shows all rules clearly.

## Goal

Be the first player to empty your hand.

## Setup

- **Players**: 2-6
- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck
- **Deal**: 7 cards each
- **Discard**: 1 card face-up starts the pile

## Turn Flow

1. View your hand and the top card of discard
2. Play a card that matches **rank** OR **suit**
3. If you can't play, draw from deck
4. Special cards trigger automatic effects
5. First to empty their hand wins

## Actions

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| Select Card | Play a matching card |
| Draw | Draw a card from deck |
| (After Jack) | Choose a suit |

## Special Cards

All rules are visible and automatic - no guessing required.

| Card | Effect | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Ace** | Skip | Next player loses their turn |
| **2** | Draw Two | Next player draws 2 cards (can stack by playing another 2) |
| **7** | Transparent | Any card can be played after a 7 |
| **8** | Reverse | Play direction reverses |
| **Jack** | Wild | Can be played on anything, you call the new suit |
| **Queen** | Silence | Next turn has limited UI (no card descriptions) |

## Stacking Draw Twos

When someone plays a 2, you can:
- Play another 2 to pass the stack to the next player (+2 more)
- Draw all stacked cards

Example: If 2 is played, next player plays another 2, the following player must draw 4 cards (or play another 2 to make it 6).

## Variants

### Standard
All special cards active (A, 2, 7, 8, J, Q)

### Simple
Only 2 (Draw Two) and J (Wild) are special
Good for beginners

### Chaos
Start with 10 cards instead of 7
Longer, more chaotic games

## Custom Mode

Available in Custom mode with variant selection.

## Ranked/SVS

- **Ranked**: ❌ No (experimental game)
- **SVS**: ❌ No (experimental game)

## Tips

- Save Jacks for emergencies when you're stuck
- 2s are powerful - use them strategically
- Pay attention to which suits are scarce
- 8 (Reverse) in 2-player acts like Skip
- Watch opponent's hand size - they might be about to win
