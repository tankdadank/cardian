> ⚠️ **Experimental Game** - Requires Patreon role to play

A classic 2-player card melding game where you form sets and runs to minimize deadwood.

## Goal

Form melds (sets and runs) to reduce your deadwood to zero (Gin) or knock when your deadwood is ≤10.

## Setup

- **Players**: 2
- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck
- **Deal**: 10 cards each
- **Discard**: 1 card face-up starts the discard pile

## Card Values (Deadwood)

| Card | Points |
|------|--------|
| A | 1 |
| 2-10 | Face value |
| J, Q, K | 10 |

## Melds

### Sets
3-4 cards of the same rank
- Example: 7♠ 7♥ 7♦

### Runs
3+ consecutive cards of the same suit
- Example: 4♥ 5♥ 6♥

## Turn Flow

1. **Draw**: Take from deck OR discard pile
2. **Organize**: Form melds in your hand
3. **Discard**: Place one card on discard pile
4. (Optional) **Knock/Gin**: End the round if deadwood allows

## Actions

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| Draw from Deck | Take the top card from deck |
| Take Discard | Take the top discard |
| Discard | Select a card to discard |
| Knock | End round (deadwood ≤10) |
| Gin | End round (deadwood = 0) |

## Ending a Round

### Gin (0 deadwood)
- Opponent cannot lay off
- You score: 25 + opponent's deadwood

### Knock (≤10 deadwood)
- Opponent can lay off cards on your melds
- You score: opponent's deadwood - your deadwood

### Undercut
- If opponent's deadwood ≤ your deadwood after layoffs
- Opponent scores: 25 + difference

## Winning

First player to reach 100 points wins the game.

- Sometimes it's worth keeping deadwood to block opponent
