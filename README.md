## License

Cardian is source-available under the Cardian Source-Available License (CSAL) v1.0 (see `LICENSE`).  
You can run and modify it, but you can’t use it to provide a competing hosted bot/service or monetize public hosting.

Cardian recognizes two discontinuation states:

**Temporary Discontinuation**  
A public statement by Korvex indicating a pause in development. The main `LICENSE` remains active.

**Permanent Discontinuation**  
A public declaration by Korvex that development will not continue. Only then does the project transition to the Community License located in the `AFTER_DISCONTINUATION` directory.

Silence, inactivity, or delayed updates do not constitute Permanent Discontinuation.

<br>

No. The CSAL license blocks competing hosted bot/services and monetized hosting.

<details>
<summary><b>Why are some anti-abuse details not public?</b></summary>
<br>

Because people farm. Some thresholds and enforcement tuning stay private so Ranked and SVS stay playable.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens if the project dies?</b></summary>
<br>

If Korvex publicly declares Permanent Discontinuation, the project transitions to the Community License located in the `AFTER_DISCONTINUATION` directory.

Silence or inactivity alone does not trigger this transition.
