## Overview

This directory contains the **Cardian Community License (CCL)**.

The CCL only activates upon **Permanent Discontinuation** as defined in the main LICENSE file.

Silence or inactivity does not activate this license.

---

## Discontinuation Types

### Temporary Discontinuation
A `Public Statment` by Korvex indicating:
- Development pause
- Maintenance pause
- Possible future return

The main LICENSE remains active.

---

### Permanent Discontinuation
A `Public Statment` by Korvex declaring:
- Development will not continue
- Official maintenance will not resume

Only then does the CCL activate.

---

## Revival

If Korvex resumes development after Permanent Discontinuation:

- The CCL terminates 180 days after public revival notice.
- Community forks may operate during this wind-down period.
- After 180 days, operation must comply with the reinstated main license.

Revival after Temporary Discontinuation does not activate the CCL.

## Steward & Recognition

Korvex may designate a Steward during discontinuation.

Community maintainers may receive public recognition for preserving the project during inactive periods.

---

## Ownership

All intellectual property remains owned by Korvex unless formally assigned in writing.
