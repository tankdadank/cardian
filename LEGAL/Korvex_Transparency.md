## 1. Operator Structure

Korvex is independently operated by an individual.

It is not currently a registered corporation unless explicitly stated.

All authority and final decisions remain with the operator.

---

## 2. Decision Framework

Development decisions follow this priority order:

1. Legal requirements  
2. Security and abuse prevention  
3. System stability  
4. Fairness integrity  
5. Sustainability  
6. Community feedback  
7. Patreon roadmap votes  

Roadmap votes influence prioritization only.

They do not override safety, compliance, enforcement, or competitive integrity.

---

## 3. Patreon & Voting Transparency

Patreon is ecosystem-wide and account-based.

Subscribing does not:

- Increase moderation authority  
- Alter competitive outcomes  
- Override enforcement logic  
- Guarantee feature implementation  
- Create ownership or governance rights  

Insider voting applies only to roadmap direction.

Voting systems may be modified, reweighted, suspended, or discontinued at the operator’s discretion for fairness, security, or operational reasons.

Votes are advisory and non-binding.

---

## 4. Enforcement Transparency

Enforcement decisions:

- Are made in good faith  
- Are not influenced by Patreon tier  
- May include warnings  
- May result in temporary or permanent restrictions  

Appeals are permitted.

Response timing may vary due to operator capacity, including academic or real-life constraints.

Appeals do not guarantee reinstatement.

---

## 5. Service Continuity

Korvex may:

- Enter maintenance  
- Pause temporarily  
- Restrict access  
- Discontinue permanently  

No compensation is owed for interruption, suspension, or shutdown.

If permanently discontinued:

Operational user data will be deleted, subject to legal retention requirements and claims defense obligations.

Backups expire under defined retention schedules.

Open-sourcing, if it occurs, does not transfer ownership.

---
